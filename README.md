# Robot trajectory optimization using LMA C++ library.
This C++ project aims to optimize robot trajectories with multiple constraints from sensors, such as GPS, IMU, altimeter, and so on. Trajectory optimization has crutial applications in robotics.

# Requirements
This project requires LMA (Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm), Eigen, Sophus, Geodesy. Also, it is build in the ROS.
